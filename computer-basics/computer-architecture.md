# It is introduction to computer architecture
## CPU:
***Central Processing Unit***-brain of a computer.  
CPU is usually placed in a special slot called a **socket** on the computers **motherboard**.  
`Motherboard-is the main circuit board that connects all the parts of a computer.`  
The CPU tasks:
+ Doing math calculations
+ Running apps or games
+ Helping the keyboard, mouse, and screen work together
+ Storing and retrieving information during tasks
  
`Without a CPU, a computer wouldnâ€™t know what to do.`

### Main components of CPU:

`The components of a CPU include the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), CU (Control Unit), registers, cache, and clock.`

+ ***ALU***-arithmatic & logic unit. It do arithmatic tasks (like multiplication, division, addition, substraction) and logical tasks(like And, Or, Comparisons)

+ ***Control Unit***-the control unit manages the CPU by sending signals like clock, hold, and reset to its parts. It ensures all components work together to complete tasks. For example, it synchronizes data movement from cache memory to the ALU.

+ ***Memory Unit***-the memory unit stores data and instructions. Older CPUs used registers, but modern ones also have fast cache memory. The CPU fetches data from RAM, ROM, or hard disks and stores it in registers or cache during tasks.
